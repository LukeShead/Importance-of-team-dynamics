# Importance-of-team-dynamics

### What are team dynamics and how can they help or not help a team in group work?

Team dynamics are the non visable forces that can affect how a team work together to complete work, this can affect the team in a negative way or a positive way, how it is depends on the people and the kind of dynamics that are affecting them. For example if a group of friends become a team and work on a group project, they will naturally like working with each other which can lead to better efficiency. However if the group of friends become too distracted talking to each other they could risk not completing the work they are assigned. This can however, affect new people coming into the group as it can be very hard to start working and talking to a group if they are already friends, what this means is that some people could feel left out and it might even split the team into 2 groups, causing problems for the work.

On the other hand if people are put into groups with people that they do not enjoy talking too or just have a general dislike for them, then they could hinder their work as they do not want to work in a team with them and might refuse helping certain people. On the other hand it could be better as they could become friends during the project and work better together, or maybe they just want the work over and done with so they work more efficiently than they would. All of this depends on the type of people affected by the dynamics of their team.

In conclusion there are many different types of team dynamics and all of them can affect a teams ability to perform group work together, whether it be for better or worse.
